# # CIFAR10
#
# ## Objective
#
# Training models to associate images representing common objects with their class (multiclass classification).
#
# ## Context
#
# The [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are completely mutually exclusive. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

#
# ## Instructions and advice
#
# - Follow the main steps of a supervised ML project: data loading and exploring, data preparation, model training and evaluation.
# - Use the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) library for data loading and model training. If you are new to it, consider following its [official tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html).
# - Don't forget to setup your environment by importing the necessary Python packages. In particular, the [ainotes](https://github.com/bpesquet/ainotes) project contains several useful functions for [plotting](https://github.com/bpesquet/ainotes/blob/main/ainotes/utils/plot.py) and [training](https://github.com/bpesquet/ainotes/blob/main/ainotes/utils/train.py).
# - Regarding data loading and preparation, bitmap images should be normalized. You can find an example using the CIFAR10 dataset [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html#load-and-normalize-cifar10).
# - You may train and evaluate a standard MultiLayer Perceptron, using [this chapter](../ann.ipynb) as a blueprint. Warning: you will have to adapt the inputs of your network to the color images of the CIFAR10 dataset.
# - **Bonus**: train a convolutional neural network using [this chapter](../cnn.ipynb) as a blueprint. After training, compare its performance with the MLP results.
