# Computer Science

Born a few years apart, AI and computer science have always been closely related to each other. From the very beginning, AI ideas have been tested on computers, using dedicated tools or generic tools tailored to the needs of AI practitioners. Breakthroughs were made possible by the vertiginous progress of hardware and software. More recently, AI has influenced the creation of specialized devices designed for maximum performance in frequently used operations.

The following chapters aim to provide the background needed to implement AI algorithms. In addition, several prominent tools will be presented as we need them in subsequent chapters.
