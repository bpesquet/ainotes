# Computer Science

Born a few years apart, AI and computer science have always been closely related to each other. From the very beginning, AI ideas have been tested on computers, using generic or dedicated tools tailored to the needs of AI practitioners. Breakthroughs were made possible by the vertiginous progress of hardware and software. More recently, AI has influenced the creation of specialized devices designed for maximum performance in frequently used operations.

The following chapters aim to provide the background needed to implement most AI algorithms in a simple way. They assume a previous exposure to the fundamental concepts of imperative programming (variables, loops, functions, etc) in any language.
