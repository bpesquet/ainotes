### Introduction

> "The goal of Computational Neuroscience (CN) is to study relations between brain structures and functions by the means of information processing techniques." {cite}`alexandreWhenArtificialIntelligence2020`

CN deals with three major topics:

- Neuronal processing
- Learning
- Brain functions

### Relationships with other fields

CN obviously overlaps with AI (especially machine learning) and cognitive science.

A key difference is that CN is specifically interested in *understanding how these topics are implemented in real brains*, with possible effects in neuroscience and psychology.
