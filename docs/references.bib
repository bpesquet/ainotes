  abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid increase in the number of studies using evidence-accumulation models (such as the drift diffusion model, DDM) in the fields of psychology and neuroscience. These models go beyond observed behavior to extract descriptions of latent cognitive processes that have been linked to different brain substrates. Accordingly, it is important for psychology and neuroscience researchers to be able to understand published findings based on these models. However, many articles using (and explaining) these models assume that the reader already has a fairly deep understanding of (and interest in) the computational and mathematical underpinnings, which may limit many readers' ability to understand the results and appreciate the implications. The goal of this article is therefore to provide a practical introduction to the DDM and its application to behavioral data {\textendash} without requiring a deep background in mathematics or computational modeling. The article discusses the basic ideas underpinning the DDM, and explains the way that DDM results are normally presented and evaluated. It also provides a step-by-step example of how the DDM is implemented and used on an example dataset, and discusses methods for model validation and for presenting (and evaluating) model results. Supplementary material provides R code for all examples, along with the sample dataset described in the text, to allow interested readers to replicate the examples themselves. The article is primarily targeted at psychologists, neuroscientists, and health professionals with a background in experimental cognitive psychology and/or cognitive neuroscience, who are interested in understanding how DDMs are used in the literature, as well as some who may to go on to apply these approaches in their own work.},

This process can be linked to the behaviors of populations of neurons and to theories of optimality.

Progress in a variety of fields has led to a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms that evaluate evidence and reach a decision1-3. Several formalisms propose that a representation of noisy evidence is evaluated against a criterion to produce a decision4-8. Without additional evidence, however, these formalisms fail to explain why a decision-maker would change her mind. Here, we extend a model, developed to account for both the timing and accuracy of the initial decision9, to explain subsequent changes of mind. Subjects made decisions about a noisy visual stimulus, which they indicated by moving a handle. Although they received no additional information after initiating their movement, their hand trajectories betrayed a change of mind on some trials. We propose that noisy evidence is accumulated over time until it reaches a criterion, or bound which determines the initial decision and that the brain exploits information that is in the processing pipeline when the initial decision is made to subsequently either reverse or reaffirm the initial decision. The model explains both the frequency of changes of mind as well as their dependence on both task difficulty and whether the initial decision was accurate or erroneous. The theoretical and experimental findings advance the understanding of decision making to the highly flexible and cognitive act of vacillation and selfcorrection.},

  abstract = "We recorded the activity of single neurons in the posterior
              parietal cortex (area LIP) of two rhesus monkeys while they
              discriminated the direction of motion in random-dot visual
              stimuli. The visual task was similar to a motion discrimination
              task that has been used in previous investigations of
              motion-sensitive regions of the extrastriate cortex. The monkeys
              were trained to decide whether the direction of motion was toward
              one of two choice targets that appeared on either side of the
              random-dot stimulus. At the end of the trial, the monkeys
              reported their direction judgment by making an eye movement to
              the appropriate target. We studied neurons in LIP that exhibited
              spatially selective persistent activity during delayed saccadic
              eye movement tasks. These neurons are thought to carry high-level
              signals appropriate for identifying salient visual targets and
              for guiding saccadic eye movements. We arranged the motion
              discrimination task so that one of the choice targets was in the
              LIP neuron's response field (RF) while the other target was
              positioned well away from the RF. During motion viewing, neurons
              in LIP altered their firing rate in a manner that predicted the
              saccadic eye movement that the monkey would make at the end of
              the trial. The activity thus predicted the monkey's judgment of
              motion direction. This predictive activity began early in the
              motion-viewing period and became increasingly reliable as the
              monkey viewed the random-dot motion. The neural activity
              predicted the monkey's direction judgment on both easy and
              difficult trials (strong and weak motion), whether or not the
              judgment was correct. In addition, the timing and magnitude of
              the response was affected by the strength of the motion signal in
              the stimulus. When the direction of motion was toward the RF,
              stronger motion led to larger neural responses earlier in the
              motion-viewing period. When motion was away from the RF, stronger
              motion led to greater suppression of ongoing activity. Thus the
              activity of single neurons in area LIP reflects both the
              direction of an impending gaze shift and the quality of the
              sensory information that instructs such a response. The time
              course of the neural response suggests that LIP accumulates
              sensory signals relevant to the selection of a target for an eye
              movement.",

Typically, such models assume a one-to-one mapping between accumulators and responses. We explore an alternative independent-race framework where more than one accumulator can be associated with each response, and where a response is triggered when a sufficient number of accumulators associated with that response reach their thresholds. Each accumulator is primarily driven by the difference in evidence supporting one versus another response (i.e., that response's ``advantage''), with secondary inputs corresponding to the total evidence for both responses and a constant term. We use Brown and Heathcote's (2008) linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) to instantiate the framework in a mathematically tractable measurement model (i.e., a model whose parameters can be successfully recovered from data). We show this ``advantage LBA'' model provides a detailed quantitative account of a variety of benchmark binary and multiple choice phenomena that traditional independent accumulator models struggle with; in binary choice the effects of additive versus multiplicative changes to input values, and in multiple choice the effects of manipulations of the strength of lure (i.e., nontarget) stimuli and Hick's law. We conclude that the advantage LBA provides a tractable new avenue for understanding the dynamics of decisions among multiple choices.},

However, the computational processes used to make choices in more complicated situations involving three or more options are unknown. We propose a model of trinary value-based choice that generalizes what is known about binary choice, and test it using an eye-tracking experiment. We find that the model provides a quantitatively accurate description of the relationship between choice, reaction time, and visual fixation data using the same parameters that were estimated in previous work on binary choice.

Recently, additional efforts have been made to describe the temporal dynamics of these processes by adopting sequential sampling models from the perceptual decision-making tradition, such as the diffusion decision model (DDM). These models, when applied to value-based decision-making, allow mapping of subjective values not only to choices but also to response times. However, very few attempts have been made to adapt these models to situations in which decisions are followed by rewards, thereby producing learning effects. In this study, we propose a new combined reinforcement learning diffusion decision model (RLDDM) and test it on a learning task in which pairs of options differ with respect to both value difference and overall value. We found that participants became more accurate and faster with learning, responded faster and more accurately when options had more dissimilar values, and decided faster when confronted with more attractive (i.e., overall more valuable) pairs of options. We demonstrate that the suggested RLDDM can accommodate these effects and does so better than previously proposed models. To gain a better understanding of the model dynamics, we also compare it to standard DDMs and reinforcement learning models. Our work is a step forward towards bridging the gap between two traditions of decision-making research.},

  abstract = {Learning and decision-making are interactive processes, yet cognitive modeling of error-driven learning and decision-making have largely evolved separately. Recently, evidence accumulation models (EAMs) of decision-making and reinforcement learning (RL) models of errordriven learning have been combined into joint RL-EAMs that can in principle address these interactions. However, we show that the most commonly used combination, based on the diffusion decision model (DDM) for binary choice, consistently fails to capture crucial aspects of response times observed during reinforcement learning. We propose a new RL-EAM based on an advantage racing diffusion (ARD) framework for choices among two or more options that not only addresses this problem but captures stimulus difficulty, speed-accuracy trade-off, and stimulus-responsemapping reversal effects. The RL-ARD avoids fundamental limitations imposed by the DDM on addressing effects of absolute values of choices, as well as extensions beyond binary choice, and provides a computationally tractable basis for wider applications.},
