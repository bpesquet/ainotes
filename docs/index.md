# Artificial Intelligence notes

Welcome to my online collection of notes related to AI. They were created for [teaching](https://www.bpesquet.fr/teaching/), [research](https://www.bpesquet.fr/research/), or personal interest. I have tried to write them in such a way that they should be accessible to anyone wanting to learn the subject, regardless of whether you are one of my students or not.

This project is still very much in alpha stage, with many missing or incomplete chapters. Stay tuned for more content in the near future!
