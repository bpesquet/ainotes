# Artificial Intelligence Notes

Welcome to my online collection of notes related to AI. They were created for [teaching](https://www.bpesquet.fr/teaching/), [research](https://www.bpesquet.fr/research/), or personal interest. I have tried to write them in such a way that they should be accessible to anyone wanting to learn the subject, regardless of whether you are one of my students or not.
