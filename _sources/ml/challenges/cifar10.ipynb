    "\n",
    "The [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are completely mutually exclusive. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.\n",

    "## Instructions and advice\n",
    "\n",
    "- Follow the main steps of a supervised ML project: data loading and exploring, data preparation, model training and evaluation.\n",
    "- Use the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) library for data loading and model training. If you are new to it, consider following its [official tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/intro.html).\n",
    "- Don't forget to setup your environment by importing the necessary Python packages. Several helper functions (see below) have already been defined for you.\n",
    "- Regarding data loading and preparation, bitmap images should be normalized. You can find an example using the CIFAR10 dataset [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html#load-and-normalize-cifar10).\n",
    "- You may train and evaluate a standard MultiLayer Perceptron, using [this chapter](../ann.ipynb) as a blueprint. Warning: you will have to adapt the inputs of your network to the color images of the CIFAR10 dataset.\n",
    "- **Bonus**: train a convolutional neural network using [this chapter](../cnn.ipynb) as a blueprint. After training, compare its performance with the MLP results."
