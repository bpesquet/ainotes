## A recent discipline

Attended by many brilliant minds of the era, the [1956 Dartmouth workshop on Artificial Intelligence](http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/dartmouth/dartmouth.pdf) is widely considered the event that kicked off AI as a research discipline.

## The original ambition of AI

> "AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines." ([John McCarthy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)>))

> "Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it." ([Dartmouth Workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop), 1956)

> "AI is the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by men." ([Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky))

## A technical definition of AI

> "AI refers to systems that **display** intelligent behavior by analysing their **environment** and taking **actions** - with some degree of **autonomy** - to achieve specific **goals**." ([European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=51625), 2018)

AI systems can be either:

- Purely **software**-based (e.g. voice assistants, search engines, face recognition systems).
- Embedded in **hardware** devices (e.g. robots, autonomous cars, drones).

## Main areas of research

- **Problem solving** (e.g. search algorithms, constraint solving).
- **Reasoning** and **decision making** (e.g. logic, knowledge representation).
- **Machine Learning**.
- **Real-world interactions** (e.g. computer vision, natural language understanding, robotics).

## AI as a moving target

As soon as AI successfully solves a problem, the problem is no longer considered a part of AI.

## AI as a social science

AI has many social and societal implications:

- Job market transformation.
- Human/machine interactions.
- Trust and acceptability.
- Legal aspects and regulation.
- Fairness.
- Ethical use.
- Privacy and usage of personal data.
- ...

## The different flavours of AI

- **Substitutive intelligence**: replacement of men by machines on specific tasks.
- **Augmented intelligence**: human-centered AI for performance augmentation or autonomy enhancement.
- **Hybrid intelligence**: human-machine collaboration on complex tasks.

## A broader definition of AI

> "AI is an **interdisciplinary** field aiming at **understanding** and **imitating** the mechanisms of **cognition** and **reasoning**, in order to **assist** or **substitute** humans in their activities." ([Commission d'enrichissement de la langue fran√ßaise](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_d%27enrichissement_de_la_langue_fran%C3%A7aise), 2018)
