# Notes on Artificial Intelligence

Welcome to my online collection of notes related to AI. They were created for [teaching](https://www.bpesquet.fr/teaching/), [research](https://www.bpesquet.fr/research/), or personal interest. I have tried to write them in such a way that they should be accessible to anyone wanting to learn the subject, regardless of whether you are one of my students or not.

```{note}
This project is still very much in alpha stage, with many missing or incomplete chapters. Please bear with me as I'm trying to make it better.
