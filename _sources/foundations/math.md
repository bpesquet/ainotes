# Mathematics

Mathematics forms the theorical backbone of artificial intelligence. The two fields are deeply intertwined and influence each other. AI has benefited from advances in many math subfields, and math research is currently being reshaped by the perspectives opened by AI.

The following chapters aim to provide the background needed to understand the mathematical aspects of AI. They are by no mean exhaustive and assume a high school level in algebra and calculus.

[This article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/all-the-math-you-need-in-artificial-intelligence/) is another good entry point. [Paul's Online Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) is a great resource if you need a reminder on fundamental math.
